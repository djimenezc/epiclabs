# Epiclabs interview exercises


## Delete node in a Linked list. Implement an algorithm that deletes a given node from a linked list. Your algorithm will receive just the node to be deleted, and won't have access to linked list head.

## Bits manipulation. Given a 2 dimensional int array representing a display of M*N where each pixel is represented as a 24 bits number (1st byte: R, 2nd byte: G, 3rd byte: B), writes an algorithm that output a new array M'*N' with pixels re-encoded as 6 bits number.

## Find integer. Given a file that contains 4 billions of non negative integers (assume int: 4 bytes per number), write an algorithm that output a single non negative integer that is not contained in the file. Assume you have 1Gb of memory available for this.

## Requirements

- [Java SE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview)
- [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org)
